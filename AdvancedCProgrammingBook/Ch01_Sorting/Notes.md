- Sorting is a techniqueof arranging data either in ascending or descending order.
- This enables data to be readily accessed and easlity maintained.
- Also sorting makes search of element in data faster.
- There are different methods available to sort the data. The decision of which method to use depends on
	1. Time spent by programmer in coding a particular algorithm
	2. Machine time necessary for running for a program.
	3. Space necessary for the program
- Different algorithms to sort elements.
	- Bubble Sort
	- Selection Sort
	- Insertion Sort
	- Quick Sort
	- Merge Sort
	- Heap Sort
	- Radix Sort
	- Shell Sort
- Bubble Sort :
	- Simplest sorting algorithm
	- The largest number is pushed at the end of list of numbers.
	- Each number is compared with next number and their place is swiped if first number is greater than second number.
	- At the end of first pass, largest number is at the end of list.
	- So at the end of each pass one number is get sorted
