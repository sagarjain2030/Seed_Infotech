- Sorting is a techniqueof arranging data either in ascending or descending order.
- This enables data to be readily accessed and easlity maintained.
- Also sorting makes search of element in data faster.
- There are different methods available to sort the data. The decision of which method to use depends on
	1. Time spent by programmer in coding a particular algorithm
	2. Machine time necessary for running for a program.
	3. Space necessary for the program
- Different algorithms to sort elements.
	- Bubble Sort
	- Selection Sort
	- Insertion Sort
	- Quick Sort
	- Merge Sort
	- Heap Sort
	- Radix Sort
	- Shell Sort
- Bubble Sort :
	- Simplest sorting algorithm
	- The largest number is pushed at the end of list of numbers.
	- Each number is compared with next number and their place is swiped if first number is greater than second number.
	- At the end of first pass, largest number is at the end of list.
	- So at the end of each pass one number is get sorted

- Selection Sort :
	- This algorithm is faster than Bubble sort.
	- Data movement is less compared to Bubble sort.
	- Smallest number in the list is replaced at the top of current list.
	- At each pass, list of start till that pass is sorted.
	- [program](selection_sort.c)
- Insertion Sort :
	- Insertion sort can be of 3 types
		- Simple Insertion Sort
		- List Insertion Sort
		- Insertion Sort using Binary Search
	- Simple insertion sort is more efficient than Bubble sort.
	- Each element is picked up and inserted in it's proper place. IF some element in the list is picked for inserting, all elements before it will be in proper order.
